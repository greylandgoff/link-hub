📌 On‑Page SEO Checklist

Title Tags
	•	Ensure every page has a unique title (Ideal length: up to 60 characters).
	•	Position the primary keyword near the start of each title.
	•	Keep them readable and natural—avoid jamming in too many terms.

Meta Descriptions
	•	Write a distinct meta description for each page (max 155 characters).
	•	Include your primary keyword and, if possible, a relevant secondary keyword.
	•	Write compelling text that promotes clicks, e.g., include benefit or a call to action.

Keyword Density
	•	Use your primary keyword around 1–2% of total text—about once every 100–200 words.
	•	Sprinkle secondary keywords and synonyms naturally to support relevance.
	•	Avoid over-optimization: steer clear of repetitive, awkward phrasing.

Header Tags (H1–H6)
	•	Confirm each page has exactly one H1 tag, containing the primary keyword.
	•	Use H2/H3 headings to structure sections logically (benefits, features, FAQs).
	•	Include keyword-rich subheaders where relevant—but keep them reader-focused.

Content Optimization
	•	Ensure content is well-written, authoritative and tailored to target users.
	•	Match content length to intent: detailed guides for complex queries; shorter for quick info.
	•	Break up blocks with short paragraphs, bullet lists, and subheads—improves readability.

Internal Linking
	•	Link to relevant pages using descriptive anchor text (avoid “click here”).
	•	Ensure there are no broken or outdated links—fix any 404s.
	•	Build a clear site structure so link equity flows to key target pages.

Image Optimization
	•	Rename images with descriptive, keyword-focused file names (e.g., rent-bobby-feature.jpg).
	•	Add alt text that accurately describes the image and includes keywords where appropriate.
	•	Compress images (using tools like TinyPNG or WebP format) to reduce load times.

URL Structure
	•	Use short, keyword-rich URLs, e.g., /services/rent-bobby, not ?id=123.
	•	Avoid complex parameters—opt for static, readable URLs.
	•	If changes are needed, implement 301 redirects from old URLs to new.

Mobile Responsiveness
	•	Test the site on mobile using tools like Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test.
	•	Ensure fonts, buttons, and images scale and adapt to smaller screens.
	•	Improve mobile load speed: optimize CSS/JS, leverage lazy loading.

🔧 Tailored Recommendations for rentbobby.com

Given your content and audience focus (renting Bobby?), here are the highest-impact actions:
	1.	Home & Services Page Titles
	•	E.g., change from generic “Home” to something like:
“Rent Bobby – Affordable Equipment Rentals | RentBobby.com”
	2.	Meta Descriptions Example
	•	For service page:
“Need rental equipment fast? Rent Bobby offers reliable machines at great rates—reserve yours today!”
	3.	Content & Keywords
	•	Ensure your key terms (e.g., “equipment rental,” “Bobby rentals”) appear in the first 100 words, headings, and anchor text linking to deeper pages.
	4.	Internal Linking Flow
	•	Link from blog content or service descriptions back to main rental categories, using anchor text like “see full rental catalog.”
	5.	Images
	•	Check every photo—make sure they’re renamed and compressed. Each should have an alt describing the item (e.g., “Bobby cement mixer side view”).
	6.	URL Audit
	•	Check whether URLs are friendly. If yours are dynamic, plan a redirect map to transition to static URLs without losing page authority.
	7.	Mobile Speed Boost
	•	Run mobile speed tests (e.g., PageSpeed Insights), and follow their specific recommendations—often around image compression, caching, or reducing JavaScript.
